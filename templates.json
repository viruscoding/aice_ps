    "prompt": "This is a technical and stylistic re-rendering of a vintage photograph. The goal is to make this exact scene—with the same people, outfits, poses, and scenery—look as if it were captured today by an elite portrait photographer using modern, professional equipment and a vibrant color grading style. Do not change any element of the scene; instead, fundamentally transform the quality of the image capture itself. 1. Vibrant, Saturated Color Science (New Priority): This is the most important instruction: The color grading must be completely modernized, vibrant, and deeply saturated. Remove every trace of the original's faded, vintage color cast. The final colors should pop with life and energy, emulating a modern digital camera using a 'Vivid' color profile. Specifically: Make any floral patterns rich and bold. Render solid colors as strong, clean, and striking. Ensure all skin tones are warm, healthy, and full of life—completely avoiding a pale, washed-out, or muted appearance. 2. Lighting Transformation: Completely discard the original's harsh, on-camera flash lighting. Re-light the entire scene as if using a professional, off-camera studio setup. Create a large, soft key light from the front-left to sculpt the subjects' faces with gentle, flattering shadows, creating depth and dimension. Add a subtle fill light from the right to soften the shadows. Eliminate the harsh glare on any glasses and create bright, sparkling catchlights in everyone's eyes. 3. Hyper-Realistic Detail and Texture: Render the image with extreme 8K clarity. Skin must look natural, retaining age-appropriate pores and fine lines—strictly avoid a plastic or airbrushed appearance. The fabric textures must be hyper-defined: clearly show any intricate knitting, weaves of patterns, and texture of upholstery. Any wallpaper pattern should be sharp and clear. 4. Modern Camera and Lens Optics: The final image must look like it was captured on a high-end, full-frame digital camera with a sharp 85mm prime lens to create a subtle, natural separation between the subjects and the background. Ensure the dynamic range is wide, with deep, rich blacks and clean, controlled highlights."

    "prompt": "Transform this illustration into a photorealistic PVC anime figure. Keep the original character’s design, pose, and colors exactly the same. Render it as a collectible figurine made of PVC plastic, with realistic painted surface and detailed shading. Apply glossy highlights on areas such as the hair and clothing, matte finish on the skin, and subtle seam lines as seen in real manufactured figures. Place the figure on a simple round display base, with a soft shadow cast beneath it. Use a neutral studio background, professional studio lighting, sharp focus, shallow depth of field, as if photographed for a catalog."
